# Basic-LZ77
  This is the basic implementation of the LZ77 algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78). LZ77 is a basis for the algorithm that zip uses taht is called DEFLATE(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE). Only difference is that DEFLATE takes the output of the LZ77 then constructs huffman encoding.
  
 ## Feature Work
 ..* Turn this into DEFLATE by adding huffman encoding.
 ..* Instead of brute force approach use suffix array or suffix tree.
